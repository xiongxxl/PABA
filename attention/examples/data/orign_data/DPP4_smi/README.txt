DPP-4 inhibitors (DPP4) was extract from ChEMBL with DPP-4 target. It filtered with IC50 activity and it satisfied that the target organism was Homo Sapiens. Then the data was processed by removing salt and normalizing molecular structure, with molecular duplication examination, leaving 3933 molecules.

The data file contains a csv table, in which columns below are used:
    - "Activity(IC50)" - IC50 activity was the activity of each molecular structure (IC50) changed into a negative value. It was in Molar unit (pIC50=-log(IC50*10-9))
    - "Activity(pIC50)" - pIC50=-log(IC50*10-9)
    - "smiles" - The SMILES represntion of the molecules
