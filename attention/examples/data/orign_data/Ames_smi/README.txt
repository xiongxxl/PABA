The Ames dataset is extracted from a study on the prediction of the ames mutagenicity. The bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) to detect mutagenicity in vitro is important in drug discovery and development as an early alerting system for potential carcinogenicity and/or teratogenicity. The dataset includes 6512 compounds and corresponding binary labels from Ames Mutagenicity results.\cite{hansen2009benchmark}


The data file contains a csv table, in which columns below are used:
    1. "Canonical_Smiles": canonical Smile string
    3. "Activity": 0 indicates negative compounds, 1 indicates positive compounds
