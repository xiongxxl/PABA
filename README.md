 Reaction Center Prediction by Analyzing Attention Matrices of a Chemical Language Model.
 
  1. input the trained network to obtain the attention matrix. The pre-trained parameters can be accessed at the following URL:https://github.com/WeilabMSU/PretrainModels/blob/main/README.md
  2. input it into the PABA network to output molecular fragments, then compare with dictionary of functional dictionary  to find functional group.
  3. Input reactants and predict reaction center.
