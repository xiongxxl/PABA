 Reaction Center Prediction by Analyzing Attention Matrices of a Chemical Language Model.
 
  1. input the trained network to obtain the attention matrix. The pre-trained parameters can be accessed at the following URL:https://github.com/WeilabMSU/PretrainModels/blob/main/README.md
     After downroading "pretrainModels-main" ,put 'attention' file.
  2. inputing sample "input_smiles" for outputing molecular fragments, then comparing with dictionary of functional dictionary  to find functional group.
  3. Inputing reactants to 'data/inputs_smiles/sample', and  result of predicting  reaction center is in 'result/statistics_reactive'.
